# ChainText

## Update
I made this project while taking a class about Markov chains in spring 2024, without NLP knowledge. I am currently taking a class on NLP (spring 2025), and have come to understand that this project is essentially an n-gram model (with only the bigram version implemented so far). Given my new understanding of n-gram models, this project is trivial, and will likely not be fixed, improved, or maintained.
