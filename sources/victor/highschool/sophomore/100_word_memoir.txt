Hot afternoons in August, working to be better at football
Hard work and pushing myself to the limit
Sweat dripping, shins splinting, head aching, but no complaining
It is what must be done to be what I want to be
Plus I have all my friends there as well
And coaches that work behind the scenes for us
Work for chilly September and cold October
To play against other rivals with a tense competition
Then finally the end of the season comes,
But it is just the beginning of the offseason grind for the next
The grind will never stop
