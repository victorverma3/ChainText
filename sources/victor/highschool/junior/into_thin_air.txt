So, I read the book into thin air by Jon Krakeur. I liked the book, it was interesting and somewhat suspenseful, although I already knew before I started reading that it was a disaster story, so it was pretty obvious to me from the beginning of the book that some people were probably going to die. 


One thing that I find kind of crazy is that Krakauer, who was already a famous author because he had already written Into the Wild by this point, was actually present during this disaster. The fact that he was actually involved in the climb and could have just as easily been one of the victims is just something that I cannot get over. 


The book itself starts out of order. It starts while Krakeur is at the summit. I felt like this was kind of random and did not like it Krakeurs choice to start it here. I would much rather have preferred that he stayed completely in chronological order, just as he did for most of the book. After a chapter devoted to the history of Everest, Krakeur starts his story by describing his arrival to the Himalayas, and the reader meets many of the people who are going to go on the expedition with him (the main characters), such as guides Andy Harris and Rob Hall. I believe that Krakeur had an initial uneasy feeling about the climb because he thought that the expedition members were not that experienced, which I guess was pretty reasonable considering what happened. 


After this the climbers travel to base camp and try to adjust to the conditions, particularly the altitude. The base camp itself had pretty good conditions with heated water and fresh food, which is better than what I expected. One of the concepts that are talked about at base camp is the competition between climbing companies. Krakeur also explains the climbing process around here; they are going to go up slowly so that they can adjust to the change in altitude. I feel like the climbing to the summit is kind of repetitive so I’m just going to tell a few of the bigger details. Throughout those chapters, Krakeur describes the struggles of climbing, as many people get frostbite from the harsh weather, and Krakeur also finds multiple dead bodies on the mountain. The events seem to get worse however, as one of the members of another team (an Asian team I think) dies. As the weather gets worse, there is also a backlog as lots of climbers are all trying to go towards the summit at close times. Another thing that caused traffic was that Krakeur says that a lot of the ropes to help climbing were not set up before the climbers came. Krakeur reaches the summit, but does not have much celebration, and starts descending pretty soon. After this point, I’m not really gonna describe much because I feel like it spoils the climax of the book, but the descent downwards is much worse than the climb. Weather dramatically worsens, and this creates a lot of deadly conditions that the climbers have to face. 


So a few things that I liked about this book
* I liked that although it was a nonfiction book, it was really a story, which made it much easier to read in my opinion. It was actually interesting because I was compelled to find out what happened next. 
* I also liked the style of the book, like how Krakeur wrote it. He sprinkled in a decent amount of factual information, such as how the tours compete and how the sherpas are involved, but he also did not go overboard and only told the essentials. The rest of the book was just about the story of the climb itself.


Recommendation
* I’d definitely recommend my book to others. I feel like it is definitely dependent on the audience though. I think that people should be atleast mature enough to handle basic things like the struggle and pain described in the book, and stomach the sad moments.
* The people who read this book should also like adventure books, like books that are more narrative, but also realistic. People who only like comic, romance, sci-fi books probably won’t not like this book as much. I’d say the best genre would be people who like books that are action and adventure, suspense/thriller, and maybe even detective/mystery fans because the book has many twists and turns during the experience.
