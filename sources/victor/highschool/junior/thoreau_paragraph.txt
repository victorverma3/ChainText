Throughout the passage, Thoreau attempts to convince the reader to partake in a simple lifestyle, much like the one he is living. To persuade his audience, Thoreau repeatedly uses personal pronouns to create a sense of unity and connection between himself and the reader. The connection is necessary to build trust with the reader; if the reader trusts and connects with Thoreau, they will be more inclined to heed his advice. To achieve this, Thoreau consistently uses inclusive phrases such as “I assure you”, “I am glad”, and “our lives” (1318). These phrases refer directly to Thoreau’s experiences and beliefs, and communicates them to the reader. This style of writing portrays Thoreau as someone who is honest and speaks their mind, and also as someone who cares about the reader as well. This strengthens the connection between Thoreau and the reader. As a result the reader is more likely to follow Thoreau’s advice, making his argument both strong and successful.
