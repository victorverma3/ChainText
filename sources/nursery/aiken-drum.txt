There was a man lived in the moon, lived in the moon, lived in the moon. 
There was a man lived in the moon, 
And his name was Aiken Drum! 

Chorus: 
And he played upon a ladle, a ladle, a ladle. 
And he played upon a ladle, 
And his name was Aiken Drum! 

And his hat was made of good cream cheese, of good cream cheese, of good cream cheese. 
And his hat was made of good cream cheese, 
And his name was Aiken Drum. 

And his shoes were made of crysty pies, of crusty pies, of crusty pies.
And his shoes were made of crysty pies,
And his name was Aiken Drum. 

And his coat was made of good roast beef, of good roast beef, of good roast beef. 
And his coat was made of good roast beef, 
And his name was Aiken Drum. 

And so on...
