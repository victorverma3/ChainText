Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree.
Up went pussycat and down went he. 
Down came pussycat, away Robin ran,
Says little Robin Redbreast, "Catch me if you can!" 

Little Robin Redbreast jumped upon a spade. 
Pussycat jumped after him, and then he was afraid. 
Little Robin chirped and sang and what did pussy say? 
Pussycat said "Meow, meow, meaow!", and Robin flew away.
