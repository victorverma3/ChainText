He rocks in the tree tops all day long, 
        Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song. 
        All the little birds on Jaybird Street 
        Love to hear the robin go tweet-tweet-tweet! 

        Rockin' Robin, 
        Rockin' Robin, 
        Go rockin' Robin. 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight!
        Â 
        Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee, 
        Every little bird in the tall oak tree. 
<a href="a-wise-old-owl.html">The wise old owl</a>, the big black crow, 
        Flappin' their wings saying: "go bird, go!" 

        Rockin' Robin, 
        Rockin' Robin', 
        Go rockin' Robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight! 

        A wordy little raven at the bird's first dance,
        Taught them how to do the bop and it was grand, 
        They started going steady and bless my soul, 
        He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole. 

He rocks in the tree tops all day long, 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song.

Rockin' Robin, 
Rockin' Robin, 
Go rockin' Robin. 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight! 

Pretty little raven at the bird band stand, 
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand, 
They started going steady and bless my soul, 
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole. 

He rocks in the tree tops all day long, 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song.
