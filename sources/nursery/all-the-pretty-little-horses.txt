Hush-a-bye, don't you cry
Go to sleep, my little baby
When you wake, you shall have
All the pretty little horses
Dapples and grays, pintos and bays
All the pretty little horses!

Way down yonder
In the meadow
Poor little baby, crying Mama
Birds and the butterflies
Flutter round his eyes
 Poor little baby crying Mamma.


Hush-a-bye, don't you cry
Go to sleep, my little baby
When you wake, you shall have
All the pretty little horses
Dapples and grays, pintos and bays
All the pretty little horses!
