Oranges and lemons,
      Say the bells of St.Clement's.

      You owe me five farthings,
      Say the bells of St.Martin's.

      When will you pay me?
      Say   the bells of Old Bailey.

      When I get rich,
      Say the bells of Shoreditch.

      When will that be?
      Say the bells of Stepney.

      I`m sure I do not know,
    Says the great bell of Bow.
