Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack 
All dressed in black, black, black 
With silver butt'ns, butt'ns, butt'ns 
All down her back, back, back 

She couldn't read, read, read 
She couldn't write, write, write 
But she could smoke, smoke, smoke 
Her father's, pipe, pipe, pipe 

She asked her mother, mother, mother 
For fifty cents, cents, cents 
To see the hippos, hippos, hippos 
Jump the fence, fence, fence. 
They jumped so high, high, high 
They reached the sky, sky, sky 
And didn't come back, back, back 
Till the 4th of July-ly-ly! 

(July can't walk, walk, walk 
July can't talk, talk, talk 
July can't eat, eat, eat 
With a knife and fork, fork, fork 

She asked her mother, mother, mother 
For 5 cents more, more, more 
To see the hippos, hippos, hippos 
Jump over the door, door, door. 
They jumped so low, low, low 
They stubbed their toe, toe, toe 
And that was the end, end, end 
Of the elephant show, show, show!
