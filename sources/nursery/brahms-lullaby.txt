Lullaby, and good night
With pink roses bedight
With lilies o'er spread
Is my baby's sweet head
Lay you down now, and rest
May your slumber be blessed
Lay you down now, and rest
May your slumber be blessed!

Lullaby, and good night
You're your mother's delight
Shining angels beside
My darling abide.
Soft and warm is your bed
Close your eyes and rest your head
Soft and warm is your bed
Close your eyes and rest your head.

Sleepyhead, close your eyes
Mother's right here beside you
I'll protect you from harm
You will wake in my arms
Guardian angels are near
So sleep on, with no fear
Guardian angels are near
So sleep on, with no fear.

Lullaby, and sleep tight
Hush! My darling is sleeping
On his sheets white as cream
With his head full of dreams
When the sky's bright with dawn
He will wake in the morning
When noontide warms the world
He will frolic in the sun.
