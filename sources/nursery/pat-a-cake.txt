Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man.
      Bake me a cake as fast as you can,
      Pat it and prick it and mark it with B,
      And bake it in the oven for baby and me.

      Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.
      Bake me a cake as fast as you can,
      Pat it and prick it and mark it with B,
And bake it in the oven for baby and me.
