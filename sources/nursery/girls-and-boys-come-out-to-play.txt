Girls and boys come out to play
      The moon doth shine as bright as day
      Leave your supper, and leave your sleep
      And join your playfellows in the street.
      
     Come with a whoop, and come with a call
        Come with a good will or not at all
        Up the ladder and down the wall
      A penny loaf will serve you all.
      Girls and boys come out to play
      The moon doth shine as bright as day
      Leave your supper, and leave your sleep
    And join your playfellows in the street.
