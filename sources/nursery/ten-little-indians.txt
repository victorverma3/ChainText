One little two little three little Indians
Four little five little six little Indians,
Seven little eight little nine little Indians
Ten little Indian boys.

Ten little, nine little, eight little Indians
Seven little six little five little Indians
Four little three little two little Indians 
One little Indian boy.

<strong>Tip:</strong> Singing with girls? You may change "Ten little indian boys" and "One little indian boy" with "Ten little indian girls" / "One little indian girl".
Singing with both boys and girls? Why not sing "boys/boy" and "girls/girl" every second time?
