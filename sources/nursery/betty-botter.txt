Betty botter bought some butter
But, she said, the butter is bitter
If I put it in my batter
It will make my batter bitter
But a bit of better butter
Would make my batter better.

So she bought a bit of butter
Better than her bitter butter
And she put it in her batter
And the batter was not bitter 
So, that was better Betty Botter
Bought a bit of better butter.
