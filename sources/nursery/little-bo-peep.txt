Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep
      And can`t tell where to find them
      Leave them alone
      And they'll come home
      And bringing their tails behind them
      Little Bo peep fell fast asleep
        And dreamt she heard them bleating,
        When she awoke, she found it a joke
        For they were all still a fleeting
      Then up she took a little crook
        Determined for to find them.
        She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed
        For they`d left their tails behind them
      It happened one day, as Boo Peep did stray
        Into a meadow hard by
        There she espied their tails side by side
        All hung on a tree to dry
      She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye
        And over the hillocks went rambling
        And tried what she could
        As a shepherdess should
    To tack again each to its lambkin
