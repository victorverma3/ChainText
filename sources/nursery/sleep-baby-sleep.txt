Sleep, baby, sleep 
        Our cottage vale is deep; 
        The little lamb is on the green 
        With woolly fleece so soft and clean. 
        Sleep, baby, sleep... 

        Sleep, baby, sleep 
        Down where the woodbines creep; 
        Be always like the lamb so mild 
        A kind, and sweet, and gentle child. 
        Sleep, baby, sleep...
