Don't you remember, don't you know, 

          Don't you remember Cotton-eyed Joe? 
          Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe, 
          What did make you treat me so? 
          I'd been married forty year ago 
          If it hadn't a been for Cotton-eyed Joe! 

          Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe, 
          He was de nig dat sarved me so, 
          Tuck my gal away from me, 
          Carried her off to Tennessee. 
          I'd been married forty year ago 
          If it hadn't been for Cotton-eyed Joe! 

          Hi's teeth was out n' his nose was flat, 
          His eyes was crossed, 
          but she did n't mind dat. 
          Kase he was tall, and berry slim, 
          And so my gal she follered him. 
          I'd been married forty year ago 
          If it hadn't been for Cotton-eyed Joe! 

          She was de prettiest gal to be found 
          Anywhar in de country round; 
          Her lips was red n' her eyes was bright, 
          Her skin was black but her teeth was white. 
          I'd 'been married forty year ago 
          If it hadn't been for Cotton-eyed Joe! 

          Dat gal, she sho' had all my love, 
          N' swore fum ne she'd never move, 
          But Joe hoodooed her, don't you see, 
          N' she run off with him to Tennessee, 
          I'd been married forty years ago, 
          If it hadn't been for Cotton-eyed Joe!
