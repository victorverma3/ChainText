Old Mother Hubbard
Went to the cupboard
To give her poor dog a bone.
But when she got there
The cupboard was bare
And so the poor dog had none.

She went to the Baker's
To buy him some bread.
When she came back
The poor Dog was dead :(

She took a clean dish
To get him him some tripe.
When she came back
He was smoking his pipe.

She went to the Alehouse
To get him some beer.
When she came back
The Dog sat in a chair.

She went to the Tavern
For White Wine and Red.
When she came back
The Dog stood on his head.

She went to the Fruiterer's
To buy him some fruit.
When she came back 
He was playing the Flute.

She went to the Taylor's
To buy him a Coat.
When she came back
He was riding a Goat.

She went to the Hatter's
To buy him a hat.
When she came back
He was feeding the Cat.

She went to the Barbers
To buy him a wig.
When she came back
He was dancing a Jig.

She went to the Cobbler's
To buy him some Shoes.
When she came back
He was reading the news.

She went to the Sempstress
To buy him some linen.
When she came back 
The Dog was spinning.

She went to the Hosier's
To buy him some hose.
When she came back 
He was drest in his clothes.

The Dame made a Courtesy
The Dog made a Bow.
The Dame said your Servant
The Dog said Bow - Wow!
