Oh, where, oh, where 
        Has my little dog gone? 
        Oh, where, oh, where 
        Can he be? 

        With his ears cut short 
        And his tail cut long, 
        Oh, where, oh, where 
        Can he be?

        Oh where, oh where 
        Has my little dog gone?
Oh, where, oh, where 
Can he be?
