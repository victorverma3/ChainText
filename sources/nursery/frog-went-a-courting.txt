A frog went a-courting and he did ride, a-hum, a-hum!
        A frog went a-courting and he did ride, a-hum, a-hum!
        A frog went a-courting and he did ride
A sword and a pistol by his side
A-hum! A-hum! A-hum!

He rode up to Miss Mousy’s door, a-hum, a-hum!
He rode up to Miss Mousy’s door, a-hum, a-hum!
He rode up to Miss Mousy’s door
He’d been there many times before
A-hum! A-hum! A-hum!

A frog went a-courting and he did ride, a-hum, a-hum!
A frog went a-courting and he did ride, a-hum, a-hum!
A frog went a-courting and he did ride
With Miss Mousy by his side
A-hum! A-hum! A-hum!
