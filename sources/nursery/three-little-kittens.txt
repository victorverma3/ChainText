Three little kittens,
      They lost their mittens,
      And they began to cry,
      Oh, mother dear,
      We sadly fear
      Our mittens we have lost.
      What! Lost your mittens,
      You naughty kittens!
      Then you shall have no pie.
      Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow.
      You shall have no pie.

      The three little kittens,
      They found their mittens,
      And they began to cry,
      Oh, mother dear,
      See here, see here,
      Our mittens we have   found.
      What! Found your mittens,
      You darling kittens!
      Then you shall have some pie.
      Purr-rr, purr-rr, purr-rr,
      You shall have some pie.

      The three little kittens,
      Put on their mittens,
      And soon ate up the pie
      Oh, mother dear,
      We greatly fear
      Our mittens we have   soiled.
      What! Soiled your mittens,
      You naughty kittens!
      Then they began to sigh,
      Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow.
      They began to sigh.

      The three little kittens,
      They washed their mittens,
      And hung them out to dry
      Oh mother dear,
      Look here, look here,
      Our mittens we have washed.
      What! Washed your mittens,
      You're such good kittens.
      I smell a rat close by!
      Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush!
      Hush! Hush! Hush!
    I smell a rat close by.
