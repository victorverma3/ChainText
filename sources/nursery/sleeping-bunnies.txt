See the bunnies sleeping till itâ€™s nearly noon
        Shall we wake them with a merry tune?
        They're so still, are they ill? 
        Wake up little bunnies!
        Hop little bunnies, hop, hop, hop
        Hop, hop, hop - Hop, hop, hop
        Hop little bunnies, hop, hop, hop
Hop, hop, hop...
