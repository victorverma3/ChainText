Round and round the cobbler's bench
    The monkey chased the weasel
    The monkey thought it was all in fun
    Pop! goes the weasel.

      A penny for a spool of thread
    A penny for a needle
    That's the way the money goes
    Pop! goes the weasel.

   Every night when I get home
 The monkey's on the table
 Take a stick and knock it off
 Pop! goes the weasel.
