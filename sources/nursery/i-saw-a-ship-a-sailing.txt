I saw a ship a-sailing, 
        A-sailing on the sea. 
        And, oh, but it was laden 
        With pretty things for thee. 

        There were comfits in the cabin, 
        And apples in the hold, 
        The sails were made of silk, 
        And the masts were all of gold. 

        The four-and-twenty sailors, 
        That stood between the decks, 
        Were four-and-twenty white mice, 
        With chains about their necks. 

        The captain was a duck, 
        With a packet on his back, 
        And when the ship began to move, 
        The captain said, "Quack! Quack!"
