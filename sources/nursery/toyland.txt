Toyland, toyland, 
        Wonderful girl and boy land. 
        While you dwell within it, 
        You are ever happy there.

        Childhood's joy land, 
        Mystic merry toyland. 
        Once you pass its borders, 
        You can never return again. 

        When you've grown up, my dears, 
        And are as old as I, 
        You'll laugh and ponder on the years, 
        That roll so swiftly by, my dears, 
        That roll so swiftly by. 

        Childhood's joy land, 
        Mystic merry toyland. 
        Once you pass its borders, 
        You can never return again.
