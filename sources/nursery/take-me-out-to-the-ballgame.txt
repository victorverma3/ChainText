Katie Casey was baseball mad, 
        Had the fever and had it bad. 
        Just to root for the home town crew, 
        Ev'ry sou, 
        Katie blew. 
        On a Saturday her young beau, 
        Called to see if she'd like to go, 
        To see a show, but Miss Kate said; 
        No, I'll tell you what you can do: 

<strong>Take me out to the ball game, 
        Take me out with the crowd. 
        Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, 
        I don't care if I never get back. 
        Let me root, root, root for the home team, 
        If they don't win, it's a shame. 
        For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out, 
        At the old ball game. </strong>

        Katie Casey saw all the games, 
        Knew the players by their first names. 
        Told the umpire he was wrong, 
        All along, 
        Good and strong. 
        When the score was just two to two, 
        Katie Casey knew what to do, 
        Just to cheer up the boys she knew, 
        She made the gang sing this song:

<strong> Take me out to the ball game, 
Take me out with the crowd. 
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, 
I don't care if I never get back. 
Let me root, root, root for the home team, 
If they don't win, it's a shame. 
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out, 
At the old ball game. </strong>
