Apple on a stick 
        Makes me sick 
        Makes my heart beat two forty six 
        Not because it’s dirty, 
        Not because it’s clean, 
        Just because you kissed a boy behind a magazine! 
        Boys, girls having fun 
        Here comes Johnny with a pickle up his bum, 
        He can wiggle he can wobble 
        He can even do the splits 
        But I betcha 10 dollars 
        He can’t do this; 
        Close your eyes and count to ten, 
        If you muck it up you’re a big fat hen 
        1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10...
