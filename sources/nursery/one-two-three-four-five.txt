One, two, three, four, five, 
          Once I caught a fish alive,
          
          six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
          
          Then I let it go again.

          Why did you let it go?
          
          Because it bit my finger so.
          
          Which finger did it bite?
    This little finger on the right.
