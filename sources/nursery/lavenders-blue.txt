Lavender's blue, dilly, dilly (or diddle, diddle)
Lavender's green
When l am King, dilly, dilly
You shall be Queen!
Call up your men, dilly, dilly
Set them to work
Some to the plough, dilly, dilly
And some to the pond.
Some to make hay, dilly, dilly
Some to cut corn
While you and I, dilly, dillyKeep ourselves warm.
