Oh, where have you been, 
Star Light Star Bright, Star Light Star Bright? 
Oh, where have you been, 
Charming Billy? 
I have been to seek a wife, 
She's the joy of my life, 
She's a young thing 
And cannot leave her mother. 

Did she bid you to come in, 
Star Light Star Bright, Star Light Star Bright? 
Did she bid you to come in, 
Charming Billy? 
Yes, she bade me to come in, 
There's a dimple in her chin. 
She's a young thing 
And cannot leave her mother. 

Can she make a cherry pie, 
Star Light Star Bright, Star Light Star Bright? 
Can she make a cherry pie, 
Charming Billy? 
She can make a cherry pie, 
Quick as a cat can wink an eye, 
She's a young thing 
And cannot leave her mother. 

Did she set for you a chair, 
Star Light Star Bright, Star Light Star Bright? 
Did she set for you a chair, 
Charming Billy? 
Yes, she sat for me a chair. 
She has ringlets in her hair. 
She's a young thing 
And cannot leave her mother. 

How old is she now, 
Star Light Star Bright, Star Light Star Bright? 
How old is she now,
Charming Billy? 
Three times six and four times seven, 
Twenty-eight and eleven, 
She's a young thing 
And cannot leave her mother.
